Where the	Lehigh's rocky                  rapids
 Rush from out the                               West, 
   Mid a grove of spreading                   chestnuts
      Walls in ivy                               dressed.
          On the breast of old South                Mountain
	       Reared against the                           sky,
	             Stands our noble Alma                     Mater,
		            Stands our dear                         Lehigh.
