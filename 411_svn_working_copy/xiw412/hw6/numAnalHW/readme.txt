Guidance:
1) Please "gmake clean" and "gmake" to obtain excutable file invert.

2) Enter directory debug/
   i)./invert see default output
   ii)./invert -format see file format
   iii)./invert matrix1_xiw412.txt or ./invert matrix2_xiw412.txt see results of two inverse matrixes calculated
   by simple inversion algorithm and partial pivoting algorithm. matrix1_xiw412.txt makes no difference
   when it is cauculated by both algorithms, while matrix2_xiw412.txt does make a difference.

3) The explanation of the difference between two algorithms is contained in pivot_xiw412.txt

4) To read my commented file, please enter directory source/
